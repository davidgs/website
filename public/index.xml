      <description>It’s that time of year again. The time when the world’s largest order fulfillment operation experiences its heaviest load. No, not Amazon - we’re talking about Santa Claus, Inc. - the largest logistics company in the world, with a 24-hour global delivery window at peak load.
This year is different, however. Earlier this year, Saint Nick clicked on an ad on his Facebook feed, one promising a digital nomad lifestyle through automating his business.</description>

      <description>You what? I changed jobs. Again. Yes. I did. But there&amp;rsquo;s a good reason for it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that long ago that I posted about leaving InfluxData and joining QuestDB as their Head of Developer Relations. In fact, it was only 6 months ago. And yet, here I am, once again, posting about a job change. This is, you may notice, not characteristic of me. I was at Sun for 15 years, then Riverbed for 2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back to Particle.io again. I saw that they were having a 30% off sale on the new Argon and some developer kits, so I had to jump on it, since I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten any new Particle hardware in years. So, what follows is a complete guide to connecting one of these kits to QuestDB in order to store the data, and then building a dashboard on top of it with Grafana .</description>

      <title>What Happens When you Put Your SQL Database on the Internet</title>

      <description>And then we posted it to Hacker News.
If you listen to, well, pretty much anyone rational, they will tell you in no uncertain terms that the last thing you ever want to do is put your SQL Database on the internet. And even if you&amp;rsquo;re crazy enough to do that, you certainly would never go post the address to it on a place like Hacker News. Not unless you were a masochist anyway.</description>

      <description>Using Python to Access QuestDB I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep this post really short, because almost all the real content is going to be in the tutorial itself. And this isn&amp;rsquo;t it! What Is This What I&amp;rsquo;ve built is.n interactive tutorial to get you started with QuestDB using Python. It&amp;rsquo;s very straightforward, and as long as you have Python 3.x installed, you should be almost ready to go. I say &amp;ldquo;almost&amp;rdquo; because you will need to install QuestDB locally in order to complete the tutorial.</description>

      <description>This is really a follow-on to my post from last week where I connected an Arduino with a temperature and humidity sensor to QuestDB.
It&amp;rsquo;s one thing to send data to your database, but being able to visualize that data is the next logical step. So let&amp;rsquo;s dive right in to doing that.
QuestDB is rather new, and hence we haven&amp;rsquo;t completed our Grafana Data Source Plugin yet, so I wanted to make a quick dashboard to show the incoming temperature/humidity data (and you&amp;rsquo;ll see just how awful the sensor really is).</description>

      <description>As you can well imagine, I&amp;rsquo;ve been super busy in my hew job at QuestDB so this has taken me longer than I would have liked, but here we are. If you know me at all, you know that one of the first things I always do with new things is, well, connect things to them! So I immediately went to connect an IoT device to QuestDB to see how it went.</description>

      <description>As you are well aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing IoT for almost 20 years (yeah, not a typo!). And for the last 2.5 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying that IoT knowledge to Time Series Databases. Also, as you are probably aware, I am no longer at InfluxData, where I&amp;rsquo;d been doing that. Long story, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really allowed to talk about it much. One thing I have discovered over the past 2 months, since leaving InfluxData, is that it appears as though I&amp;rsquo;m the only Developer Relations Professional who actually has expertise in IoT and Time Series Databases.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of projects using InfluxDB over the past few years (well, I did work there after all) so maybe I developed a bit of a bias, or a blind-spot. If you follow me on twitter, then you may have seen me post some quick videos of a project I was working on for visualizing COVID-19 data on a map.
It worked, but it was pretty slow. So much so that I had to put a &amp;lsquo;loading&amp;rsquo; overlay on it so you knew it was still actually doing something while it was querying the data from the database.</description>

      <description>Many people have seen the nifty dashboard that John&amp;rsquo;s Hopkins University put out where you can see the number of COVID-19 cases, etc. throughout the world. It&amp;rsquo;s really nice and all, but what if you wanted to slice and dice the data yourself? Well, as it turns out, they are also publishing all the underlying data in a GitHub repository! It&amp;rsquo;s all published as daily CSV (comma separated values) files. Makes it super easy to import into Excel spreadsheets, but spreadsheets are so over.</description>

      <description>A New Library Many of you Arduino enthusiasts are probably aware of the existing InfluxDB library that was maintained by Tobias Schürg for many years. Hats are off to him for providing this library and maintaining it for so long.
With the arrival of InfluxDB 2.0, it was time to update the library. Some of you may remember that I did a quick update to support the InfluxDB 2.0 OSS a few months ago, and that was working well, but InfluxData has been working towards a set of consistent, InfluxData-maintained set of client libraries.</description>

      <description>First of all, don&amp;rsquo;t ask I have no idea where this idea came from, it just happened. I keep saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not especially proud of this&amp;rdquo; but in reality? I sort of am because it&amp;rsquo;s funny as shit (pun intended). Some projects came across my twitter feed that included (I shit you not) a 3-D printable model of the 💩 emoji. I remember nothing else about that project, but you&amp;rsquo;d better believe that I went straight for that STL file!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built a lot of InfluxDB servers in my time here, and I&amp;rsquo;ve built some pretty esoteric ones at that, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally pulled off what can only be described as the World&amp;rsquo;s Smallest InfluxDB Server! Back in the summer of 2019, I saw a project on CrowdSupply.com for something called the &amp;lsquo;Giant Board&amp;rsquo;. It looked really, really cool! A complete Single Board Computer (SBC) that ran Linux, all in a Feather form factor.</description>

      <description>If you’ve deployed an IoT solution, you’ve had to decide where, and how, to store all your data. At least from my perspective, the best and easiest place to store the sensor data is, of course, InfluxDB. My saying that can’t come as a surprise to you. But what about the other data you need to store? The data about the sensors? Things like the sensor manufacturer, the date it was placed into service, the customer ID, what kind of platform it’s running on.</description>

      <guid>https://davidgs.com/posts/category/iot/sensing-with-the-things-network/</guid>
      <description>There are many ways to connect your sensors to the network in the IoT. For short-range connections, there is Bluetooth LE, or Zigbee, or 802.15.4, or ZWave. For longer distances (though still fairly short) there’s always WiFi. But when you need longer distances, sometimes very long distances, there’s LoRaWAN. It’s a sub-gigahertz set of frequencies that are available for small bits of data. These are typically only a few bytes of data but can be sent over much longer distances — up to 2 km or more in some instances!</description>

      <description>Have you ever watched the local weather — or The Weather Channel — and heard them announce the temperature, and then the &amp;ldquo;Heat Index&amp;rdquo;? Or how hot it feels outside? At least here in the United States, and especially in the South, it&amp;rsquo;s part of every weather broadcast in the summer. But have you ever wondered how they actually calculate the Heat Index? Since I collect temperature and humidity data, I decided one day I&amp;rsquo;d go and figure it out.</description>

      <title>How to Output Data from Flux to MQTT Natively</title>

      <description>Writing data from InfluxDB to MQTT using Flux I started using the Open Source (OSS) version of InfluxDB v2.0 very early on in the Alpha releases. Even in the early releases, I was very enamored with the way things were shaping up. But as you know, I do a lot of IoT builds, and use InfluxDB for all of it, so there were a few things I needed it to do that it just didn&amp;rsquo;t, yet.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been reading me for any length of time at all, you’ll know that I build lots of little hardware projects. What better way to highlight the IoT capabilities of InfluxDB than to build hardware that writes data to it constantly! But some of my hardware demos have been getting old, and some of them have been getting abused, so I decided it was time to revamp them with some new hardware, I’m even going to make them fully wireless by adding LiPo batteries so they can go mobile during presentations and demos!</description>

      <description>I’ve been a very busy man. It was only a few days ago that I wrote about a new InfluxDB library for writing data from Arduino devices to InfluxDB v2 and here I am again, writing about a new library for writing data to InfluxDB. This time, it’s in Swift. Now your native Apple apps can write data directly to InfluxDB v2.0 with ease.
It’s a really simple library to use, and you can download the entire Xcode project for it from my GitHub.</description>

      <description>I’ve been spending a lot of time lately with the 2.0 Alpha releases and I’m here to tell you: some of the new things coming are really, really cool! Especially for IoT. The one I’ve been using lately has been the ability to do math across measurements, which is really a game-changer for IoT data in InfluxDB.
Let’s look at why here for a minute. As you probably know, I’ve been building out a bunch of IoT sensors that stream data to various instances of InfluxDB.</description>

      <description>As InfluxData moves ever closer to releasing v2.0, it’s becoming increasingly important to be able to get data into InfluxDBv2, of course. Makes sense, right? Since the vast majority (like, indistinguishable from 100%) of my data comes from IoT devices, I decided it was time to start making those devices InfluxDB v2-capable.
I’m happy to say that the first step in that direction is now complete! One of my favorite sensors is a particulate matter sensor that measures the amount of very small particulate in the air (from 2.</description>

I sort of need to be, but it hasn’t been essential. I decided that it was really time to take the plunge and get serious about Go. Seriously, there’s only so much you can learn by reading the internet.
To that end, I have taken 2 actions:</description>

Finally, I have it! This is both a hardware build and a software build, and there are a lot of moving parts, so be prepared!
Overview I wanted to build a demonstration system that would show off the capabilities of using InfluxData — the entire TICK Stack — on the extreme edge of an IoT Architecture.</description>

I love my ARTIK-520 board. It runs the entire InfluxData stack nicely and is a solid, reliable place to deploy IoT-Edge software. I really like it.</description>

The basic idea As you may (or may not) know, I spent a lot of time with the Apache MyNewt project a year or so ago. It has enormous potential. It’s small, fast, and very lightweight. I even wrote a tutorial on developing an app with MyNewt.</description>

      <description>There are all sorts of ways to architect your IoT Deployment, and what’s right for one enterprise will not necessarily be right for another. Depending on the size and complexity of your IoT project , there can be, of course, a lot of components. One of the more universal architectures is to deploy sensor hubs or gateway devices to collect data from a number of sensor nodes and then forward that data on to an upstream data collection system for the enterprise.</description>

      <description>InfluxData has a thing about Time to Awesome™. So much so that they Trademarked it. No, seriously, they did. And they mean it. So let&amp;rsquo;s go from Zero to Awesome!
 We are singularly focused on reducing the Time to Awesome™, we truly care about helping developers and businesses get to results faster with less complexity and less code.
 That’s directly from the About section of their website and they really do mean it!</description>

      <description>I’ve been on Twitter for a long time. A really long time. Longer than my actual twitter profile would indicate. (I think I first joined in late 2006.) At one point, I had over 5,000 followers, but, well, basically twitter’s security and policing was so atrocious that, for reasons of personal safety, I quit twitter and deleted my account. I was gone for about 2 years. I came back and started fresh in 2012.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get to this for a couple of weeks, and have been waylaid by a bunch of other things that kept popping up, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been working away with these, and thought I&amp;rsquo;d post at least an initial post about these kits. Renesas was kind enough to give me both theS3 IoT Fast Prototyping Kit and the S7 Starter Kit, both of which are really really nice boards for doing IoT prototyping.</description>

      <description>Last week I wrote a piece on installing and running the InfluxDB time series database, ingestion, dashboard and action packages on your ARTIK-520, but I need to update that post, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more than just a few edits. Influx Data supplies the Linux binaries as packages for most of the major distributions, but the ARM distribution is just as a binary, with no package installation scripts, etc. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d show you how (and why) I fixed that for my ARTIK-520.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, the IoT is about data. I said it just a few weeks ago. It&amp;rsquo;s about collecting data. Lots of data. But it&amp;rsquo;s actually about a lot more than just collecting data. Simply collecting data doesn&amp;rsquo;t really get you anywhere if all you do is collect it. To be useful, IoT data has to be relevant, accurate, and actionable. That last part is the key, really. Actionable data. In order to make your data actionable, you have to be able to analyze it, in real time preferably.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not usually one to publicly take a company to task like this, but, well, this is a rather special circumstance. I&amp;rsquo;ve been an avid Withings fan, and advocate, for years. I was one of the very first people to get a Withings Activité watch. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve actually invested pretty heavily in Withings gear. I bought my wife a Withings Pop. I bough a Withings Body Analyzer Scale. I bought a Withings Wireless Blood pressure Cuff.</description>

      <description>Yeah, I know, &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; as a buzz-word is so 5 minutes ago. The tech world is chronically ADD and prone to being distracted by the next shiny object (OOh! Look, IoT!, Wait, AI! SQUIRREL!!) But stay with me on this. It&amp;rsquo;s all connected. I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying since at least 2005 (back when Big Data was all the rage) that you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen truly big data until the IoT truly gets going in full force.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with a bunch of different sensors lately (see here) so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do another little write-up of it. I dug my Particle Photon out to play with after being inspired at an NC RIoT event a few weeks ago and it had been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;d had it out. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to share the exact problem I was trying to solve with this little application, as it&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress and may very well end up being a product soon, but I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you how I&amp;rsquo;m doing it.</description>

Hell, until recently, I didn&amp;rsquo;t either, which is a crime really because it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing group of IoT fanatics doing some really cool stuff with IoT. I even met a guy who does as many crazy things with IoT as I do &amp;ndash; you should follow @LogicalDan on twitter, and tweet at him in case he&amp;rsquo;s wearing his shirt that lights up when you tweet at him.</description>

      <description>You may recall that at one point a year ago I posted a picture of my &amp;ldquo;Big Board of IoT Development&amp;rdquo;. I had a half dozen or so IoT development nodes and some sensors on it that I was working on. Since then, things have gotten significantly worse &amp;ndash; or better, depending on your point of view. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d drop another picture on you. {width=&amp;ldquo;600&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;450&amp;rdquo;}
So obviously I can&amp;rsquo;t use all those boards on the giant breadboard.</description>

Unless you happen to have extra HDMI monitors, keyboards and mice lying around. I don&amp;rsquo;t, so configuring mine was a pain in the ass. I&amp;rsquo;ve solved that pain for you, so read on.
First, of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to download and install the latest Raspian-OS.</description>

      <description>Doing some further work with my trusty ARTIK-520 (hey, when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail! Back up off me! ) I decided to try installing another IoT Gateway framework on it. (I&amp;rsquo;ve done that before.) Equal opportunity and all that. And I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more of them as soon as I get more mini-SD Cards in-house. But I digress.
I originally just followed the basic install instructions for deploying a Droplit.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve already set up a Droplit.io edge server, and an Eclipse Kura server, so why not give one more a try right? Right. So let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing woodworking of one form or another for a long time. I love the feel of wood in my hands, and creating something out of wood is one of my favorite things to do. So I do it whenever I can.
This is but a small sampling of some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve done, and more will surely follow.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say, for argument&amp;rsquo;s sake, that you have a Samsung ARTIK-520 (I assume this will work on other ARTIK modules aside from the ARTIK-0 ones) and you have it all configured the way you want, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose anything. Or maybe you just want to replicate it a dozen times onto a dozen different ARTIK-520s. As it stands right now, apparently, the answer is &amp;ldquo;good luck with that&amp;rdquo; as there is no mechanism to actually dump a running ARTIK-520 to a Mini-SD Card that can then be used to install it again.</description>

      <description>After I installed and tried the Zulu Embedded JVM on my ARTIK-520 this morning I noticed that it felt faster. It seemed faster. But was it really faster? And if so, how much faster? So I went looking for some Java Benchmark tests to run. I chose the DaCapo Benchmark for this. Why? Because google, that&amp;rsquo;s why. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the DaCapo Benchmark says about itself*:
 This benchmark suite is intended as a tool for Java benchmarking by the programming language, memory management and computer architecture communities.</description>

It was an excellent little How To on getting started with ARTIK-520 and IoT!)
It was suggested to me (these little birdies keep feeding me interesting nuggets to try) that I try the Azul Zulu Embedded JVM as an alternative to the OpenJDK JVM that is installed by default.</description>

      <description>There are about a million ways to build or buy an IoT Gateway Device. (Actually, more like 586,000, but let&amp;rsquo;s not quibble). Each has it&amp;rsquo;s own merits, or pitfalls. You could buy one, and risk being locked into a single-vendor solution. You could build one from scratch and then be saddled with having to source the hardware, build the software, and then maintain it all and hope that you made the right choices and that it will scale.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time over the last few months working on the Apache MyNewt IoT OS. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is, then you really should! It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly new Apache Project, still in the &amp;lsquo;incubating&amp;rsquo; phase, but they&amp;rsquo;re about to release their second beta of the 1.0 release (I think all the votes are in to approve it). Yes, there are some things still missing, and some rough edges, but it&amp;rsquo;s coming together nicely and if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an Open Source IoT OS for your device, MyNewt may just what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.</description>

If you read the Hardware Extravaganza Post, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I got an ARTIK-0 and an ARTIK-5 developer kit not long ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to my ears in MyNewt though and haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to do much with them, sadly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of work on the Mynewt OS Project over at the Apache Software Foundation. It&amp;rsquo;s still &amp;lsquo;incubating&amp;rsquo; so it&amp;rsquo;s not a full-fledged Apache project yet, but we&amp;rsquo;re making huge progress and it&amp;rsquo;s coming along nicely. In fact, we&amp;rsquo;re just releasing our first beta versions of the 1.0 release! If you&amp;rsquo;re an IoT hacker, and are looking for a small, fast, highly configurable (and open source!) RTOS, MyNewt it the ticket!</description>

      <description>I saw a cool animation someone did on the git activity of an open source project, so I decided to do one of my own. I’ve been contributing to an open source RTOS for IoT called MyNewt (pronounced minute, as in really small) so I decided I’d see what a visualization of the project looked like over the past year. It’s mesmerizing.
As you can see, the growth of the project over the past year is pretty nice, and watching it grow is really cool.</description>

      <description>Let’s call it a Pandora Pi, shall we? Anyway, I have a (non-technical) friend that was always envious of the music setup I have in my house. I have a bunch of Bose Series III speakers set up around the house, connected to Airport Express Basestations so that I can broadcast music throughout the house. There’s always music playing around here, usually throughout the whole house — kitchen, living room, office, etc.</description>

      <title>The Art of the Resume</title>

      <description>If you ask 100 people about what a resume should be, you’ll likely get close to 100 answers.
 “It should be no more than 1 page long”  “it should have a statement of objective” “never put your interested on a resume”  “only list your last 3 jobs”  And on and on. Most of it is conflicting, and pretty much none of it will work for everyone. These days, resumes are a crap-shoot.</description>

      <description>Just for future reference, here’s the development board that sits on my desk:
What’s on it? Well, here’s the list:
 Intel Edison: One on the (mostly useless) Intel Mini Breakout board and one on a Sparkfun Block (more on this one in a later post) Electric Imp A couple of Arduinos — they’re actually RFDuinos, which I backed on Kickstarter. A Particle Photon A NodeMCU Some random sensors I’m working with.</description>

      <description>If you’ve been following along lately, you’ll notice that a bunch of stuff has been happening with me. First, I lost my job, Then I started a company, Dragonfly IoT, and made myself the CTO of it (because I could, you know). And yesterday I was appointed the new CTO of another startup, Chimera IoT. So that’s a lot of jobs, and a lot of CTO jobs, for just one person.</description>

      <description>I’ve been a loyal Tile user since I first baked their Kickstarter project. I love the idea of being able to locate things I lose all the time, like my keys, and to keep track of stuff I might lose, like my DSLR, my GoPro, etc. I even used them to keep track of my cats when they wee indoor-outdoor cats. I at least knew when they were around even if I couldn’t find them.</description>

      <description>I need to amend my previous post about the Intel Edison. It turns out it may not be the Edison module itself but rather the Intel Mini-Breakout Board that is at fault when t comes to at least the I2C failure. I still have to see about the SPI failures. Here’s why I have reached that conclusion:
I ordered some of the Sparkfun Blocks for Intel Edison© and went back to fooling with them.</description>

      <description>It was almost exactly a year ago that I bought my first Intel Edison development kit. I was all excited about the prospects of it, as you can see here. It’s a nice, small, powerful (if power-hungry) IoT board that held a lot of promise for development and prototyping.
I wish I were still as excited about it. I’ve tried, a couple of times, to use it for some development project or another.</description>

      <description>I should have posted this back in October, but a few things happened. So I’m posting it now. I saw a few articles on the Spark.io board a while back, and had been anxiously awaiting its release. Then I got really really busy, and forgot all about it. Then I got unbusy again, and lo and behold, it was now called particle.io, and they had a few different boards. The Photon and the Electron.</description>

Really bad timing to be looking for a full-time gig what with the holidays, the end of many companies’ fiscal years, etc. Great timing. I decided it was time to take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and do something about it myself So I have co-founded Dragonfly IoT, a full-service IoT company.

      <description>In case you haven’t heard about it yet, there is going to be a large virtual IoT Conference this year called IoT Slam ’15. If you haven’t submitted a topic for a session yet well, it’s too late. The Call For Papers closed last week. I thought about submitting a topic, but I was just too busy with engineering work, at the time, to pull it off. As you know, all that changed.</description>

As you may or may not know, I’ve been working as the Chief Technology Evangelist for a startup called PsiKick for the past 7 or 8 months. They have some pretty amazing technology for potentially making the Internet of Things battery less. It’s a great company, with great, and really smart, engineers. We were doing some great things, and starting to gain some traction.</description>

      <description>During an interview today, I was asked the question “So where do these numbers come from? How do we get to 20 billion IoT devices?” Great question! How, exactly, do we get to 20 billion (or 30 billion, or a trillion) IoT devices? We’re certainly not going to get there with wearable devices and other personal gadgets. Well, we might but it would be a stretch, and the probability is near-zero.</description>

      <description>Batteries will be a limiting factor in IoT deployments There’s a lot of hype about the Internet of Things (IoT) as I’ve said repeatedly — and as anyone who’s reading anything about technology these days already knows. There’s wearable tech, there’s healthcare IoT, there’s M2M IoT and a host of other areas of the IoT that are all projected to explode over the next 10 years. Billions and billions of devices are forecast.</description>

      <description>Over the holidays a friend of mine took her family to Disney World for a few days. They stayed at a resort in the park, paid extra for shorter lines at the rides, and were there in a group of 12. That’s a epic trip probably worthy of it’s own blog post — somewhere else. I couldn’t imagine the logistics of such a visit, but then again, it’s been 10 years since I’ve been to Disney World, and apparently a lot has changed in that time.</description>

      <description>It’s clear that IoT is the buzzword of the minute. Maybe the buzzword of the year. Everyone’s talking about it, mentioning it, making predictions about it and claiming to be a player in it. I am among those, but I have the background and the history to back it up. But after reading this article from Electronics Weekly.com, I’m just aggravated. It is annoyingly titled “The Internet of Things is Not Happening” which is just plain wrong.</description>

      <description>What is the Internet of Things (IoT) anyway? And what makes up the IoT ecosystem? Yes, IoT is the buzzword of the year. Yes, everyone thinks everything is IoT these days. But just because a thing connects to the internet doesn’t mean it’s IoT.
In thinking about this idea, I put together the following presentation, of sorts. It’s HTLM5, and can take a while to load, but check it out and let me know what you think in the comments section.</description>

      <description>As I’ve said before, everyone is talking about the Internet of things (IoT). It’s the buzzword du jour. It’s going to be huge, HUGE I tell you!! Billions and billions of devices connecting to the internet over the next 6 years. And that’s just the devices side of things. Then there&amp;rsquo;s the software side. The API services. The data analytics side of things. The Authentication and Identity Management areas. To say nothing of the cloud storage requirements.</description>

I’m doing more IoT stuff again — purely for fun, since no one’s paying me to do it — and I’ve recently acquired the electric imp development kit and this Intel Edison kit, as well as an Arduino kit. The Intel Edison board is by far the most powerful of the bunch. It is an IoT SoC device that appeared to be extremely capable.</description>

      <description>So what, exactly, is the Internet of Things (IoT)? And what isn’t it? That depends on whom you ask, and what you mean. There are tons and tons of ‘connected’ gadgets that people call IoT devices.But are they really IoT devices? The Internet of Things is, loosely, the world of connected, internet-enabled devices. But let’s turn to Wikipedia, just for fun:
 The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices Internet infrastructure.</description>

Of course I have the requisite unpacking porn.

      <description>Let’s face it, the Internet of Things (IoT) is hot right now. And it’s only going to get hotter. Everyone wants in on the perceived coming gold rush that will be the Internet of Things. And a gold rush is most definitely predicted! Gartner has said so here, and here. IDCsays so, too. I could go on and list how many analysts and media pundits, etc. agree, but that would just be redundant.</description>

      <description>I’m all about connectivity. Yes, there are times to disconnect from the world, but that’s a personal disconnect. Applications and devices should, for the most part, be connected all the time. But connectivity is expensive and hard to maintain in remote places. If you’re connecting a server, or your house, there are many options available — let’s just go with that for now, shall we? The whole ISP monopoly issue will just get me wound up.</description>

      <description>I freely admit that I am a gadget freak. I’ll also (sometimes) admit that it’s a problem. I bought a Cookoo Watch as a Kickstarter Backer of the project. I own a FitBit — I’m on my third one, don’t ask. I’ll probably buy an Apple Watch. But one of the problems I have with most ‘wearable tech’ is that, well, it looks too much like tech. The Cookoo Watch was a great start, but the first version was really buggy and unstable — except as a watch — and I’ve come to find out that it’s un-upgradeable and is basically a paperweight.</description>

      <description>Ok, so in addition to being a gadget freak, I’m a hardware junkie. It’s been a while since I’ve actually done much hardware hackery, but that’s not because of a lack of desire. I bought an RFDuino dev kit last year as a Kickstarter backer that I just opened last weekend, and I haven’t done much with it so far. Turns out having nothing but BTLE is a lot less useful than I thought.</description>

Yes, I do occasionally blog for my job as a Technology Evangelist at Riverbed, but there are lots of other topics I’d like to blog about that don’t seem to be right for that venue, so I’ll put them here.</description>

First we disassembled the entire doorframe, and then re-assembled it upside down. By the time he got back the &amp;ldquo;Welcome Mat&amp;rdquo; we had glued to the ceiling had fallen, but it was still great.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted anything new, and I apologize to anyone that follows along here and has missed my posting. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy lately with the MyNewt Operating System for IoT. It&amp;rsquo;s new, it&amp;rsquo;s cool, and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work right now. That being said, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a minute to show off some of the new hardware I have to add to the Big Board of IoT on my desk.</description>

      <title>My Journey into Tech and DevRel</title>

      <description>A bunch of people I know have been writing their “Journey into Tech” blogs lately, and a few of them have been pestering me to write mine, so here it is. It’s non-traditional, and filled with detours and missteps, so if you’re trying to get into tech, take heart!
Oddly enough, I was actually born into ‘tech’ at some level. My mother was a highly respected computer scientist for all of my life.</description>

      <title>Return to IoT Evangelism</title>

      <description>Things change. What’s that saying in Computer Science? “Variables won’t. Constants aren’t.” The only thing that never changes is that everything changes. And so things are (once again) changing for me. And I do mean in a good way!
It’s been a few years, and it’s taken a fair amount of effort, but I’m moving back into the space I know the best, and where my heart lies: The Internet of Things (IoT).</description>

      <description>I was blogging quite regularly here for some time, and suddenly not so much. Why is that? Well, if you follow me on Twitter, or LinkedIn, you’ll know that as a result of (well, sort of) a couple of my recent blog posts (specifically this one and this one) I was hired as the Senior Developer Evangelist at InfluxData. And I have to say, it’s awesome. Really. Fantastic company. Amazing people to work with.</description>

      <title>Why Don&#39;t you have an Evangelist Yet?</title>

      <description>To far too many people in the high tech world &amp;ldquo;Evangelism&amp;rdquo; is a dirty word. It smacks of marketing and sales and isn&amp;rsquo;t technical. Companies want technical engineers, they want marketing professionals. They want sales professionals. They overlook the importance of evangelism. This is going to be a bit long, and a bit of a personal history lesson in some ways, but stick with me and you&amp;rsquo;ll see why Technology Evangelism is so important.</description>
