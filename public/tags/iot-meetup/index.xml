      <description>If you follow me on Twitter, you&amp;rsquo;ll already know that I was at the NCRIoT IoT Meetup yesterday at the NASCAR Hall of Fame in Charlotte, NC. You may not know what NC RIoT is. Hell, until recently, I didn&amp;rsquo;t either, which is a crime really because it&amp;rsquo;s an amazing group of IoT fanatics doing some really cool stuff with IoT. I even met a guy who does as many crazy things with IoT as I do &amp;ndash; you should follow @LogicalDan on twitter, and tweet at him in case he&amp;rsquo;s wearing his shirt that lights up when you tweet at him.</description>
