      <description>Things change. What’s that saying in Computer Science? “Variables won’t. Constants aren’t.” The only thing that never changes is that everything changes. And so things are (once again) changing for me. And I do mean in a good way!

      <description>To far too many people in the high tech world &amp;ldquo;Evangelism&amp;rdquo; is a dirty word. It smacks of marketing and sales and isn&amp;rsquo;t technical. Companies want technical engineers, they want marketing professionals. They want sales professionals. They overlook the importance of evangelism. This is going to be a bit long, and a bit of a personal history lesson in some ways, but stick with me and you&amp;rsquo;ll see why Technology Evangelism is so important.</description>
