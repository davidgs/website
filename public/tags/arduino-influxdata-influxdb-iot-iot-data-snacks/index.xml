      <description>A New Library Many of you Arduino enthusiasts are probably aware of the existing InfluxDB library that was maintained by Tobias Sch√ºrg for many years. Hats are off to him for providing this library and maintaining it for so long.
With the arrival of InfluxDB 2.0, it was time to update the library. Some of you may remember that I did a quick update to support the InfluxDB 2.0 OSS a few months ago, and that was working well, but InfluxData has been working towards a set of consistent, InfluxData-maintained set of client libraries.</description>
