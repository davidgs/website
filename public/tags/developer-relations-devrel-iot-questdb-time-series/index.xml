      <description>As you are well aware, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing IoT for almost 20 years (yeah, not a typo!). And for the last 2.5 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying that IoT knowledge to Time Series Databases. Also, as you are probably aware, I am no longer at InfluxData, where I&amp;rsquo;d been doing that. Long story, but I&amp;rsquo;m not really allowed to talk about it much. One thing I have discovered over the past 2 months, since leaving InfluxData, is that it appears as though I&amp;rsquo;m the only Developer Relations Professional who actually has expertise in IoT and Time Series Databases.</description>
