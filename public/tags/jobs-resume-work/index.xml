      <description>If you ask 100 people about what a resume should be, you’ll likely get close to 100 answers.
 “It should be no more than 1 page long”  “it should have a statement of objective” “never put your interested on a resume”  “only list your last 3 jobs”  And on and on. Most of it is conflicting, and pretty much none of it will work for everyone. These days, resumes are a crap-shoot.</description>
