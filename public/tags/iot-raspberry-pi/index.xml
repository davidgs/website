      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky enough to get your hands on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, then you might enjoy this. If you&amp;rsquo;re still waiting for one, bookmark this. Unless you happen to have extra HDMI monitors, keyboards and mice lying around. I don&amp;rsquo;t, so configuring mine was a pain in the ass. I&amp;rsquo;ve solved that pain for you, so read on.
First, of course, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to download and install the latest Raspian-OS.</description>

I have a bunch of Bose Series III speakers set up around the house, connected to Airport Express Basestations so that I can broadcast music throughout the house. There’s always music playing around here, usually throughout the whole house — kitchen, living room, office, etc.</description>
