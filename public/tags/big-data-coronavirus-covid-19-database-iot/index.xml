      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of projects using InfluxDB over the past few years (well, I did work there after all) so maybe I developed a bit of a bias, or a blind-spot. If you follow me on twitter, then you may have seen me post some quick videos of a project I was working on for visualizing COVID-19 data on a map.
It worked, but it was pretty slow. So much so that I had to put a &amp;lsquo;loading&amp;rsquo; overlay on it so you knew it was still actually doing something while it was querying the data from the database.</description>
