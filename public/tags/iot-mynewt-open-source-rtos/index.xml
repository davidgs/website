      <description>I saw a cool animation someone did on the git activity of an open source project, so I decided to do one of my own. I’ve been contributing to an open source RTOS for IoT called MyNewt (pronounced minute, as in really small) so I decided I’d see what a visualization of the project looked like over the past year. It’s mesmerizing.
As you can see, the growth of the project over the past year is pretty nice, and watching it grow is really cool.</description>
